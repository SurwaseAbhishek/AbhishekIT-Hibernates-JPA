What is Data Persistant ?
-------------------------
Persistance : Storing the data permenantly.
It has 3 component :
1) Data : represents what is persist.
2) Medium :represents how to persist.
3) Storage :represents where to persist.

Data in java 
------------
Row data : stores in different variable.
Java object : class object.

ACID : properties are there for data.
-> To read and write data we have iostream classes.
-> In java have serialization/deserialisation which convert java objects into bytes and vice-versa and can be write in file.

Data :
------
	1) Row Data
	2) objects

Medium :
--------
	1) java I/O streams
	2) serialization/deserialisation
	3) JDBC 

Storage :
---------
	1) file
	2) Database 
 
 -> Every file contain Some Extension like .c .cpp .html but file which is not 
 related to perticular technologies is called flat file.
  
 # Drawback of using file as data storager
 -----------------------------------------
  -> Data Redundancy 
  -> Data Inconsistency  [ data is in two file and after modifying one file changes has to be redirected in second one also if not happened it is called as data Inconsistency]
  -> Data Security 
  -> Storage
  -> No Transaction support 
  -> No Constraint support
 
@Solution for this is : <Database>

 
 Data / Java Objects     ----->   JDBC    ----->  Database
 ===================              ====            ======== 
 
 To perform CRUD operations JDBC technologies is use.
 
 Requirement : Want to store Employee Objects into Database using JDBC vice-versa?
 So problem is it deal with queries so 
 executeUpdate(Employee) : Error (Employee is object)
 executeQuery(Employee) : Error 
 insert into emp_table values(Employee) : Error
 
 Process : 
 =========
		    1) Getting Data by getter methods after getting values 
            2) Create PreparedStatement object of JDBC
		    3) Now set Data to PreparedStatement and ExecuteQuery.
