@ What is JPA
-------------
# Java persistant API
# initially multiple venders provide ORM tool to make object Model and Relational Model to work Together.
# Switching from 1 ORM tool to Another ORM tool is hard form developer
  so sun-microsystem give specification Of JPA it is interfaces but not implementing classes
  all ORM venders provide implementation of there specific ORM tool and hybernate is one of them.
# Most of JPA specification is created by teking the features from hibernate and some features from TopLinks.

JPA [specification]
-------------------
# All this are JPA Providers / Vendors
-> hibernate
-> EclipseLink
-> OpenJPA

# What is difference between the DAO classes directely using hibernate and using JPA ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If we write the DAO classes directely using hibernate then whenever if we want
  to switch to Another ORM tool all the DAO classes must be modified.
# If we write the DAO classes using JPA the whenever if we want to switch to Another ORM tool,
  just we only need to modify thr project configuration file


Features of hibernate
=====================
1) HQL (hybernate Query Language) :
-----------------------------------
select * from Employee     -> SQL 
select e from Employee e   -> HQL

select ename,eno from Employee    -> SQL
select e.EmployeeName,e.EmployeeNo from Employee e  -> HQL

# It is HQL own Query Language.
# Hibernate provides HQL to make the DAO classes as DB-independent.
# SQL are DB dependent HQL are DB independent.
# SQL and HQL are same they dont bother on developer.
# In SQL we use columnName and table. whereas in HQL we use class Name and Reference.
